# Specification Quality Checklist: eVaka Deployment Tracker

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-03-02
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass validation after clarification session. Spec is ready for `/speckit.plan`.
- Clarification session (2026-03-02) resolved 2 questions: deployment history persistence strategy and PR listing scope for wrapper cities.
- Existing implementation (evaka-version-tracker) reviewed to confirm technical details: version endpoint response format (`apiVersion` = commit SHA), submodule resolution, PR message patterns, bot PR detection.
- Former assumptions about version endpoint format have been upgraded to "Confirmed Technical Details" section based on existing code review.
